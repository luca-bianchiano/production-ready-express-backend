# Production-Ready Express Backend

This is a **production-ready Express backend project**, designed to serve as a **starting point for scalable backend servers**. It can be integrated with both **web clients** and **mobile clients**.

## Features

- Built with **Express.js** for fast and scalable backend.
- Uses **Prisma** as the ORM for database management.
- Supports **GraphQL** API using **Apollo Server**.
- Connects to **MongoDB** as the primary database.
- Ready to serve as a starting point for production projects.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file and add required variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secrets).

4. **Run the server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

or for production:

```bash
npm start
```
